## Backend part
All deps are quite outdated :)  
Backend techs:  
Groovy, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring REST, Spring Data, MongoDB etc.

Backend is still used by [next-ololos-blog](https://github.com/RIP21/next-ololos-blog)


## Frontend part
This one is legacy and left out there for history to make lulz in the future :)  
Using React 15, Redux, React Router v3, styled-components v2 and server-side rendering with express and hackery.
